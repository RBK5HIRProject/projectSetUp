## Scrum Guidelines
2-day sprints between Dec 8th to Dec 20th
4-day sprints between Dec 22nd to Dec 30th
2-day sprints between Dec 31st to Jan 10th

The Time section of the table are hours recommended for you to spend during each sprint. 
Please prioritize your own off-time, well-being, and RBK assignments over this commitment. 
However, this is a high impact project that not only exponentially increase your employability, but also benefits RBK years down the line. Every hour you pour in will be evident to the growth of the organization.
